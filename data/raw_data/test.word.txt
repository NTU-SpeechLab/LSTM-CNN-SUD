she was subpoenaed an abortion clinic is bombed in alabama and a man is killed and tobacco executives on capitol hill pledging a whole new attitude we'll take a closer look
from a. b. c. news world headquarters in new york thursday january twenty-ninth this is world news tonight
peter good with evening jennings the crisis in the white house may seem on the surface to be a little less intense but that is probably misleading there is some threat to the president lurking in every corner today two main developments the independent counsel kenneth starr and the lawyer for monica lewinsky have not been able to resolve whether ms lewinsky will testify about her relationship with the president in exchange for immunity from prosecution and there are serious questions today about a meeting between the president and ms lewinsky after she was subpoenaed to testify about the relationship so first here's a. b. c.'s jackie judd
after a brief meeting with the independent counsel lawyer william ginsburg curtly said that he was preparing monica lewinsky's defense a sign that little or no progress had been made in securing lewinsky's testimony ginsburg is holding out for full immunity and starr thinks that she has more to say than she has about the president what lewinsky can do for starr is fill in the blanks in a series of events filling in those blanks starr believes could prove that there was an effort to get her to lie about her relationship with mr clinton in exchange for a job the events began on december seventeenth lewinsky is subpoenaed by lawyers for paula jones who want evidence of sexual misconduct by mr clinton december twenty-eighth eleven days after lewinsky receives the subpoena administration sources say lewinsky meets with the president according to the new york times mr clinton asks her to say her trips to the white house were to visit someone else january seventh lewinsky signs an affidavit swearing under oath there was no affair but it is not filed in court the next day january eighth lewinsky has her second job interview at revlon vernon jordan has said he arranged that because he was impressed with lewinsky's drive and ambition january thirteenth revlon offers her a job january sixteenth seventy two hours after the job offer is made the affidavit denying an affair is filed with the court starr meanwhile made a dramatic move today he asked that the paula jones lawsuit be halted because her lawyers were trying to get at the same witnesses starr is pursuing the judge would only agree to exclude anything having to do with lewinsky in his motion starr revealed more than he ever has before about his view of the clinton lewinsky investigation he said it raises issues of the gravest concern and is of paramount importance to the nation peter
jackie thanks very much jackie judd in washington tonight a. b. c.'s chief legal analyst jeffrey toobin joins us this evening jeffrey on the basis of what you know is this meeting illegal or ill-advised
well it is definitely not a crime simply to meet with a a witness in a case in which the president is is one of the parties but it seems terribly ill-advised it raises all sorts of questions it's suspicious the president will now have to answer what was said why why did you say it why did you hold the meeting then if you never hold the meeting you never have to answer those questions
jeff toobin thanks very much at the white house today the president's spokesman was not at all forthcoming about monica lewinsky and that white house meeting on december the twenty-eighth as a. b. c.'s sam donaldson reports tonight sam the white house has its strategy has its strategy has its strategy right
right peter perhaps uh everyone would like to know what the president has to say about that story but neither he nor the people who speak for him will talk about it naturally the president's press secretary mike mccurry was asked if monica lewinsky visited mr clinton on december twenty-eighth
aus i'm not going to piecemeal respond to uh questions that have been raised and i on on that on that specific question i don't have anything from the counsel's office that i can provide
it's really an easy question to answer when visitors are passed through the white house gates their names are entered in a computer system that records who cleared them in and who they are visiting
pardon us please
that was presumably one of the reasons betty currie the president's personal secretary was called to testify before the grand jury sources have told a. b. c. news she often cleared lewinsky in and the visitor computer records are being turned over to prosecutor kenneth starr's office but the white house won't make them public a lot of other questions should be easy to answer also for instance has the president discussed the investigation with lewinsky in any way at any time has the president in fact given lewinsky any gifts and above all just what was the president's relationship with monica lewinsky surely he knows the answers to all these questions but his press secretary made it clear today that he doesn't and really doesn't want to you told us very carefully that you don't know
which i am may out be things of a the good loop i'm position not for even you sure to i'm be not in even sure on this matter there is a loop
well loop or no loop what they say here is that all of this will come out at the appropriate time and that presumably is when the investigation has been concluded until then peter the watchword here is stonewall and just hope that the questions go away
sam thanks very much sam donaldson at the white house there is other news today on capitol hill the men who run the five largest tobacco companies came to promote a three hundred and sixty-eight billion dollar national settlement on tobacco and as a. b. c.'s barry serafin reports now that what they testified to congress would have been unthinkable just a few years ago
they chose their words carefully but unlike their predecessors four years ago tobacco executives today acknowledged that nicotine is addictive
under some definitions cigarette smoking is addictive
yes i think uh under the way people use the term today i agree it is
and they acknowledged health risks
does uh smoking have a significant impact in a as a risk factor in relation to lung cancer
yes yes it does
despite recent tobacco company documents showing that they had targeted children officials insisted that is not their policy
it is immoral it is unethical as well as illegal to market to people under age
many committee members were still skeptical as a gesture of good faith the tobacco executives said they would release millions of industry documents now under seal in a minnesota court case but officials there say tobacco companies are still fighting the disclosure of the most damaging documents barry serafin a. b. c. news washington
quite a change that testimony from almost four years ago later in the broadcast we'll take a closer look at just how much things have changed for tobacco companies and why and in just a moment a fatal attack at an abortion clinic in alabama there has been another bombing at an abortion clinic and for the first time in one of these bombing attacks someone has been killed it happened in birmingham alabama near the university and tonight a federal task force is on the case here's a. b. c.'s rebecca chase
the explosion ripped off the front awning of the abortion clinic and shattered windows those first on the scene quickly discovered that it had been a deadly blast
when the officers arrived they found that one person was injured and there was one fatality
a nurse opening the clinic was badly injured and is in critical condition an off duty police officer was apparently killed immediately nearby student dormitories were quickly evacuated
the windows rattled there was a loud bang it was very loud
law enforcement officials immediately cleared a four block area their concern has been that there might be a second bomb that's what happened at an atlanta abortion clinic bombing a year ago
