uh uh an and as we go on perhaps uh we may hear some testimony about that but as far as i know there's been no testimony that any activity like that was engaged in by the national policy forum am
i correct i think every witness with knowledge has told you specifically that none of that was done and i said it in my remarks that there was no to candidates there's no political advertising no contributions to campaigns parties pac's there was no pac affiliated with this there's no independent expenditure no issue advocacy advertising no get out the vote no voter registration no nothing
i'll reserve the balance of my time and m call on senator brownback
thank you very much mr chairman and uh welcome mr barbour to the committee thank you for uh for coming here and i think you uh you set a nice example by being here and being willing to testify and standing up and answering questions and i hope it's an example that a lot of other witnesses are willing to take on the particular issue of attempts by non u. s. citizens or foreign entities be they governments or corporations or others to influence u. s. policy i want to go at that narrow issue and i want to go at it specifically and i want to go at it in general just to to let you know what i'm curious about because it seems to me that that's the biggest issue we're really trying to delve into is the a the attempts by foreign entities to influence u. s. elections and what's what's taking place now going at it specifically to start off with um uh mr ambrose yung is the the key figure that we've been talking about here with you uh and a guarantee of the loan he did to the national policy forum he then authored some articles or at least one article didn't he in the n. p. f. uh publication
common yes sense is sir that correct yeah it's it's published as two different articles i'm not sure that it might have once been one that was so long it got split into two but it but it is two articles as it shows up in the in common sense which was our quarterly journal yes sir
now why why was he asked or why did he and why di was he willing to write those
well he was as i asked him and i asked him because in talking to him it was clear that what his views that he expressed that night at dinner were consistent with not only republican policy but the policy of the united states and that is that there's one china you know we have a one china policy we've had it under republican and democrat administrations and so this guy was the head of a family uh that we were trying to get to help so i asked him if he'd like to write when he wrote the john bolton who was the president of the national policy forum at the time was a former assistant secretary of state uh who edited the articles and the articles were pretty well plain normal american not only republican but american policy toward toward china the policy nixon had the policy bush had reagan clinton but he wrote it because i asked him to
do you know if he was trying to uh uh push a particular policy position that was was contrary to anything you had been thinking or within the republican party
n not as far as i could tell and senator i don't want to hold myself out to be a foreign policy expert but a as far as i could tell it's the pretty standard policy of both parties that we've had since the since the uh nationalist chinese fled the mainland of taiwan in the in the forties that we recognize that there is one china with two governments
now you also uh i believe introduced mr young to it was then speaker elect gingrich and and uh uh senator dole is that correct
i believe probably s that speaker gingrich was speaker by then i don't th i i think there's a letter that talks about him being speaker l i think he was probably already speaker
were you at those meetings
yes sir i was at both of them
could you could you tell us what was discussed uh at those meetings as best as you can remember
th they were both cour courtesy calls casual you've been in the leaders office on the senate side you know the waiting room out in
were the were there specific policy issues discussed at either or both of those meetings
n nothing other than what's happening in asia you know senator dole and speaker gingrich what's going on what's going to happen when hong kong goes back to the p. r. c.
now mr young though must have been articulating a particular point of view or else he wouldn't have noted the speaker a couple of days later going counter to his point of view what
we the only thing i know and we've since this s started i've got somebody to go back and read the articles again that knows more about it than i j just typically that there's one china which has been the policy of our government that we ought to engage china which was the policy of the clinton administration and the bush administration past administrations that we ought to have trade i don't know what he's talking about that newt said something different i just remember it because i thought it was funny when somebody uh somebody told me that mr young had said that n newt did something totally different as far as the effect is concerned senator
di did mr young articulate any point of view that you can recall that specifically would have helped uh young brothers uh development company either in this country or uh in china or hong kong
u anywhere taiwan u i i he he di he never said anything to me or in front of me about his company's business or businesses or his companies' businesses or bus
did he ever s did he say anything to speaker gingrich or
no sir i was there no sir he did not
so these were general discussions but generally about foreign policy
in about asia particular on about what asia was going on asia china hong kong where he lives
l l let me take you because m my time gets short as everybody's here
well it should i be apologize i'll try not to talk as
much no that's alright but d taking you to a broader picture because you've had a great deal of experience politically and in uh this nation and and have traveled overseas a number of foreign entities be they corporations or governments have a great deal of interest of what happens in u. s. electoral politics isn't that correct
well well sure the america's the leader of the world
so they w look here and they watch our trade policy's very important to them our defense policy is extraordinarily important to them our recognition of nations uh most favored nation status these are very important policy issues
yes sir
so they follow those closely do you know in any of your experience or or background of any systematic effort by a foreign entity be it a government uh or a corporation to try to influence u. s. policy and change that policy
s senator i if you talk about campaigns t this this election nineteen ninety-six is the first time since i've been involved in the politics in the sixties that i've ever heard it even discussed the possibility that some foreign government was trying to affect u. s. elections first time ever if you mean policy you know i i have a a an article here or a note about an article the japan foundation in nineteen ninety-one gave five and a half million dollars in grants to a number of american think tanks uh the brookings institution the aspen institute senator bennett asked specifically about them well they've they both got a a million and a quarter each from the japan foundation which is perfectly legal but i i think clearly that the think tanks do uh get a lot of support from uh from foreign entities like i say this is
perfectly a this is legal a new york but times article n
but funded there what about foreign corporations
as we listen to haley barbour uh get some fairly friendly questions from kansas republican senator uh sam brownback we want to try to step back for just a moment and look at exactly what it is the senate governmental affairs committee is trying to get from this witness and other witnesses during this week brooks jackson who is c. n. n.'s money trail correspondent joins me now brooks again we want to i we want to reiterate this is the week the democrats on the committee were permitted to say who they wanted to call to testify it was their decision to ask haley barbour the former republican national committee chairman to talk to them and what do they want to hear from him
the main reason that we're here judy is a two point one million dollar loan and it's kind of complex but uh when you see it uh maybe not so much let me just trace it through step by step ambrose yung a hong kong business man is owner of yung brothers development hong kong that company loan uh sent two point one million dollars to its florida subsidiary young brothers development u. s. y that u. s. company then transferred the money to signet bank virginia uh and deposited it as collateral on a loan signet bank virginia then loaned that money two point one million dollars to a republican think tank the national policy forum founded by haley barbour chaired by halle haley barbour while he was also chairman of the republican national committee uh one point six million dollars of that loan then was transferred to the republican national committee just in time for the nineteen ninety-four elections um and democrats are saying that it constitutes money laundering e the republicans are saying the policy forum was a think tank separate and uh these uh this was not in effect foreign money overseas money coming to the u. s. elections
why is everybody so hot and bothered about this i mean the republican party raises money th the these politically leaning think tanks like the national policy forum raise money what was so special about this transaction
well it is unusual u and uh i i think unique in uh in in in politics but the main reason that uh democrats want to focus on it is because they took such a beating m ba last october when illegal and questionable money from overseas was coming out uh uh such an embarrassment that it may have cost president clinton uh votes it may have uh cost the democrats uh control of the house of representatives some people figure now we're having senate hearings into th uh what's primarily a democratic scandal uh naturally democrats would like to look at uh any trace of uh any hint that overseas money somehow got into republican coffers
that's right the first couple of weeks of these hearings did focus on democrat alleged democratic abuses after this week the hearings will again look at alleged democratic abuses they'll take a recess in august come back in september we've been hearing from a number of the republican senators question haley barbour in the last few minutes we want to e take you back now to a statement made by democratic senator carl levin of michigan he questioned haley barbour just a few moments ago let's listen to some of what senator levin had to say
and the i. r. s. is inaccurate you're saying in their conclusions berudi is inaccurate the commercial credit memorandum people are inaccurate all these folks are inaccurate when they call you an offshoot of a subsidiary of and it seems to me that this becomes a very critical issue for a very obvious reason and that is that if in fact they are right and that the forum was indeed run as a subsidiary of an affiliate of that the foreign money issue becomes absolutely critical and you have agreed to that because then a contribution to the forum becomes a contribution to the r. n. c. and the r. n. c. is not allowed to accept a foreign contribution and that's why the issue is so critical and i don't think it's enough for you simply to say it's irrelevant whether or not the money that came from hong kong was in fact from hong kong because then p. f. could accept a foreign corporation it is not irrelevant it is very relevant as to where that money came from because if the two organizations were affiliated as all these folks thought they were i. r. s. et cetera then that issue becomes a very very critical issue the foreign money issue now
that was democratic senator carl levin questioning haley barbour a few moments ago now we go live to the hearings where another democratic senator joseph lieberman of connecticut is also questioning haley barbour we'll listen
insurance policy of the uh of the d. n. c. and th that's why this perplexes us okay l let me ask a different kind of question generally speaking do you have um can you tell us what the annual budget of the national policy forum was the average annual budget
senator it's been about eight million dollars over three and a half years the the pattern of spending was not uniform uh m mike berudi talked about and fred wolkanczik talked about the real need for money in the first half of ninety-five
spent so was it total of eight million over the
four it years some something in excess of
eight million dollars here's my question which may not be directly related to the purposes of of our inquiry today but it fascinates me y in your opening statement you indicated that you had raised uh or th that the that three hundred and thirty million dollars had been raised for the republican national committee during the time that you were chairman which is a a uh an extraordinary accomplishment why w why were you and the others having trouble raising the eight million dollars over four years for the n. p. f. i suppose in some sense it should encourage democrats that republicans don't always succeed raising money but it it is puzzling to me and i i wonder if you uh can explain why that's so much smaller budget seems like a good idea
s well senator y you know i certainly thought so at the time and we had watched what the d. l. c. had done in terms of raising money and i i i i'm not poking fun at you the a lot of our list you all had had some sort of inaugural event where you listed a bunch of sponsors of the d. l. c. that was our original list for people to give to the to the national policy forum
another the form truth of another piece of flattery
yeah but it in in but the the the problem was a a for some reason in the middle of ninety-five uh people got i think largely because the
