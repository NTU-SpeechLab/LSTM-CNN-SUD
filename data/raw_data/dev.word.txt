and storms thunder through the midwest leaving behind bodies and a tattered landscape this program is called early prime hello i'm lou waters
and thanks for joining us i'm natalie allen well as we approach the long fourth of july weekend it looks like there's as much going on beyond planet earth as there is here on terra
isn't firma that the truth there's a full plate of experiments aboard the shuttle columbia more mir headaches and of course the mission to mars that has space scientists ah just jumping up and down national correspondent john holliman has it all covered and he's here to ah tell us all about it
all right let's find out lou and natalie it's crunch time for the long awaited mars mission finale here's the very latest on pathfinder's journey to our closest planetary neighbor it is two hundred eighty thousand miles from mars and it's just entered the martian gravitational pull the space craft is moving at about twelve thousand miles an hour but that could go up there are two more opportunities to make adjustments in it's trajectory before landing to get it down just where they want it to go a couple of very special guests joining us now going to add their insight about this project vice president al gore is chairman of the president's space council has the top job in the u. s. government for overseeing space policy he joins us from his office in the white house complex on the other side of the country nasa administrator daniel goldin is watching the mars pathfinder mission from the control center for pathfinder i want to thank you both for joining us on c. n. n. mr vice president i understand you're so excited about this mission you even have a model of the sojourner rover on your desk uh if you do show it to us and if you don't let's just talk about this the sojourner is not very expensive the mars pathfinder program not very expensive and neither is this mission in the words of dan goldin cheaper faster better doesn't cost tax payers anything like as much as the space shuttle mission in orbit right now or even the u. s. contribution to the mir space station that continues orbiting the earth with a growing list of problems is sending robots to mars the best way for the united states to explore space
well certainly for the time being it is and we're going to gain a lot of eh invaluable information john ah starting we very much hope with the pictures that will come back tomorrow night uh eastern standard time ah and this faster cheaper better approach allows us to not take such a huge risk on putting all the eggs into one basket it also allows us to learn from each successive mission so that we can redesign what the next mission looks like in order to maximize the advantages so ah we're very excited about the wonderful way nasa has responded to the challenge that president clinton and i put to them they performed magnificently and we're very optimistic that this space craft will as well you can see this model here it's a little bit too big for my desk but i got it over over here behind me and last year ah john i was out at j. p. l. and ah used the little remote control to drive the ah ah the replica they have of this thing out there and ah it it is quite a a vehicle and i can hardly wait to see these pictures tomorrow night
what do you think they're going to look like ah last time ah we had ah anything on mars it looked up at the sky and the scientists expected to see blue sky and they saw pink sky i mean eh are we going to be surprised by what we see well actually ah i think the the pictures that viking took had a a real emotional impact when you saw the ah the the rocks ah strewn across that ah a rusty red surface at least that's what it looked like to me ah these pictures will be of even higher quality some of them will be stereoscopic ah and i think that um the pictures are likely to have a profound impact and of course the other data gathered by the sojourner will also be invaluable and remember john this mission takes place in the immediate aftermath of the dramatic discovery announced ah only a few months ago ah that the scientists examining that ah ah meteorite that ah was knocked loose from mars so many million years ago came to the conclusion that in their view the evidence ah showed that life probably existed on mars at least in the in the distant past and so ah this mission comes at a moment of very high excitement in the scientific community and i think you're going to see a lot of excitement on the part of all of us a as the information comes back in
ah when you were a kid did you think there would be americans on mars by now and do you think there should be and do you think there will be
well i remember when ah sputnik went up when i was about nine years old ah and at that time ah we all let our imaginations uh run wild and ah then when an american landed on the moon and then another and another ah it seemed like ah eh we were going to witness the exploration of the whole solar system i think we still will but i think that we got to learn as we go and i think the faster cheaper better approach is definitely the right way to do it it's not a question of if human beings will go to mars it's only a question of when ah but you know we got to learn the lessons that c can be learned and must be learned through the experience of building the international space station and learning how humans can endure prolonged periods eh in space a a trip to mars and back takes quite a long time and there's much that we need to learn about the effect on human beings and in the meantime the use of these robotic missions particularly with the new microprocessing capability uh can give us an enormous amount of information about mars and it's a very exciting prospect
yeah as soon as you and i are done i'm going to talk to nasa administrator dan goldin who is out at the j. p. l. ah for tomorrow's landing i'll ask him this too but i just want to know what your gut tells you about continuing american presence on the mir space station you know the problems they got a space walk scheduled for a couple of weeks from now that may not succeed in solving the electric power problems on mir and the u. s. lab the main reason we got an american up there is shut down now talk to me like hundreds of others americans a are about this and tell me what in your heart of hearts ah you think we ought to do should we keep americans up on the mir or should we spend the hundred million dollars a year that u. s. tax payers are spending on mir and use it maybe to get their parts for the new space station built sooner
well you ask for my gut feeling and my gut feeling is that yes we will continue uh o on the mir a and continue uh in a partnership with the russians and others ah on the pathway we've now defined but ah john this is not a question that can or should be answered on the basis of a gut feeling because we are in the process of analyzing exactly ah what the situation is there we're learning a tremendous amount incidentally from ah this incident ah and as we engage in these efforts with the russians to fix the problem we'll learn a lot more and then we'll make an assessment about ah what all those lessons add up too and i hope very much that the answer will be the same as my gut feeling right now that we'll continue with the mir and i i think that's the probable outcome one way or another we are going to continue with the international space station and gain the knowledge that we need to eventually send humans on to mars uh to follow these uh robotic craft
all right mr vice president thanks for talking to us thanks for showing us your ah um your ah replica of the ah martian rover ah i it was nice to see you today
nice to see you john you're doing a great job on this space beat
mhm you're doing a pretty good job on the vice president beat too i
let's well some think people uh some people say i'm proving that robot can do it well
not going there mr vice president let's go to the jet propulsion lab where nasa administrator daniel goldin has been listening to this interview i imagine dan you work for an interesting man in the vice president i'll tell you um
i'm very i'm very proud to serve under the vice president
and his robot on his desk geeze i ah can i ask you the ah the mir question uh that i just asked him i mean you're you're much closer to this than he is you're getting the information first hand from the people who are talking to the cosmonauts and the astronauts ah ah you and i talked two months ago about this and before mike foale went up you said i'm not going to send mike foale up there if it's ah the russians can't assure us of x. y. and z. being okay they did assure you you sent foale and now you got something beyond z. that has happened in this wreck up there um how are you feeling about ah um having an american up there would the u. s. if the u. s. lab a. can't be reopened because it is leaking and b. if they can't get the power problems ah back up to closer to normal
well john first let me say that safety is the primary issue in my mind and the primary issue in the minds of our americans working on this and the russians so first we want to make sure it's safe and then secondly we want to make sure that there are adequate resources to do research because that's the purpose of a space station and ah we have a very focused process we have two internal teams we have an external team looking at it working with the russians and i expect over the next month or so we will come to some very firm conclusions and then we'll proceed
all right i it it looks worse than it did two months ago when we talked does it not
i would say the situation is worse right now but again let me let me tell you that we have gained experience in this circumstance that's going to make the international space station much more robust and much much safer i was just up at nasa ames research center ah two days ago and they showed me a a technique they're developing with neural nets which is artificial intelligence that will allow uh space craft to dock at the international space station and i it would be tolerant of errors in the mass properties or the weight of the vehicle and this could assure us of much higher levels level of safety and based upon what we learned on mir we're going to take a look at this very specific technique
yeah um i want you to know c. n. n. is getting hundreds of calls from viewers wanting to know when we're going to get the first pictures and we're telling them when we think we're going to get the first pictures from mars and what those pictures are going to show and ah people ask me that i throw up my hands i don't know do you know
yes i do ah i can tell you what we expect if things go well i think we'll see the first black and white picture sometime between four and six p. m. pacific standard time tomorrow and ah if we're successful sometime between six and seven the first color picture what to expect you know mars is very different than earth if there is a sufficient sand in the air the atmosphere will look red if it's cool and ah calm it will look blue and ah there's a chance we can even see clouds ah we've seen clouds from the hubble space telescope so that's one thing for the ah viewers to look for the other thing to look for is what type of rocks are we going to see um and how big are they and what's the distribution and this ah sojourner truth rover will be moving around and they'll get a good chance to see what ah the ah the environment looks like on another planet
yeah any of this going to help us to get human beings to mars someday
john without a doubt if we ah not if but when we send human beings we want to send human beings and have them live off the land and we have to also learn how to deal with weather conditions so this particular vehicle has a weather station on it we'll determine wind direction wind velocity temperature pressure and ah it'll help us ah do a better job in weather prediction and then we're g also going to learn where they'll spots to land ah we'll have a sense did water flow here what are the possibilities for subsurface water in two thousand and one we're going to start generating oxygen out of the martian environment so these are the kind of things we're going to be doing and this will really help us determine where to send astronauts and how to help them live off the land
all right daniel goldin administrator at nasa thank you for joining us vice president al gore thank you for checking in as well ah if ah either of you ah have comments and thoughts about this later on we'll probably check back in with you as july fourth coverage continues what a what an interesting thing you know i was talking to flip um ah our weather guy outside
he says he's going to try to be a hundred percent accurate we said there's no way to check you
yeah who's going to question flip
